# PES_ASIC_CLASS
## Objective
VLSI ASIC design involves creating custom circuits optimized for specific tasks using RTL (Register-Transfer Level) description. This involves designing digital logic using hardware description languages like VHDL or Verilog, converting it to gate-level representation through synthesis, and eventually translating it into a physical layout for fabrication. The process includes architectural design, logic implementation, verification, and testing, resulting in highly efficient and tailored integrated circuits.
## Outcome
* RTL Description
* Logic Synthesis
* Physical Design
* Verification
## Minimum Requirements
* Ram-6GB
* Ubuntu 22.04
* Disk space 100 GB minimum


  
## Day 1  Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain
### Task 1
####  C Program To Compute Sum From 1 to N (using gcc) & Spike Simulation And Debug (using RISCV)
```
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out
```
After this use the following code to implement it in spike simulator
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
spike pk sum1ton.o
```

To debug the ALP generated by the compiler
```
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
```

### Task 2
#### C program that shows the maximum and minimum values of 64bit unsigend and signed numbers.
Use the same method as you have used in task 1
and then use this code
```
unsign_sign.c
```
And then again use spike to get the result

## Day 2
### Task 1
Simulate a C program using ABI function call (using registers) and execute
